# Overview
[CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) opens the door to your cybersecurity career! It's chosen by more corporations and defense organizations than any other certification on the market to validate baseline security skills and for fulfilling the DoD 8570 compliance.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the Security+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
